# 📝 FileReaderWriter (Java)

A simple Java console program that allows users to **write text to a file** and then **read it back** — all in one run.  
It’s a great beginner-friendly example of Java file handling using `BufferedWriter` and `BufferedReader`.

## 📂 How It Works
1. The program asks you to **enter a filename** (without extension).
2. You type in lines of text — each will be saved to that file.
3. Type `exit` when you’re done writing.
4. The program then reads and displays everything from the file.
